# Genetic Algorithm Framework

## Project Overview

This project is an implementation of a genetic algorithm framework in Java. The primary components include classes for handling genes, chromosomes, genetic operations, and data logging. The framework allows for the simulation of evolutionary processes, tracking generations, and logging relevant data for analysis.

## Project Structure

- **Gene.java**: Represents a gene, the basic unit of information in the genetic algorithm. Includes methods for mutation and other genetic operations.
- **Chromosome.java**: Represents a chromosome, which is composed of a sequence of genes. Includes methods for genetic operations such as crossover and mutation.
- **Generation.java**: Handles the concept of a generation in the genetic algorithm. Manages a population of chromosomes and facilitates their evolution.
- **Evolution.java**: Manages the overall evolutionary process, including selection, crossover, and mutation operations.
